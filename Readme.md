# Introduction to Next JS

- Inspecting the page source in your browser reveals the code and actual page content.
- The visible content on the screen is part of the HTML code sent from the server.
- This differs from a standard client-side React app, where the source code shows an empty page with script imports, but not the visible content.
- Standard React apps manipulate the page on the client side in the browser.
- React.js runs in the browser, allowing the page to be edited after loading without fetching a new page.
- The disadvantage is that search engine crawlers don't see the actual page content on their first visit.
- With NextJS, the content is included in the source code, visible both on the screen and in the HTML.
- NextJS is a full-stack application framework, running code on both the client and server.
- NextJS seamlessly blends client-side and server-side code, allowing React to build full-stack applications.
